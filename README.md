# AI-WorkFlow-Agent-using-Telegram


This project showcases an intelligent AI automation workflow where your Telegram messages act as triggers for powerful AI-driven actions 🚀. With a simple command like /importantmails or /schedulemeeting, the workflow activates an AI agent that can analyze and summarize important emails ✉️, schedule meetings in Google Calendar 📅, draft professional replies 💬, or send timely reminders ⏰ — all without leaving Telegram! The system integrates Telegram Bot API, OpenAI (or any LLM), Gmail, and Google Calendar using an automation tool like n8n, Make, or Zapier ⚙️. It’s designed to simplify your daily workflow by connecting communication, scheduling, and automation into one seamless system 🌐.
